## Overview

This course provides hands-on experience with software tools used by academicians and researchers for AI-related work. The focus is on **end-to-end ML systems**: from data collection and labeling, through model development and versioning, to deployment and continuous integration. Students will gain practical skills in building reproducible, scalable, and maintainable AI systems.

The course prepares students with the necessary groundwork and exposure to the right mix of tools for modern machine learning operations (MLOps), covering the complete lifecycle of AI projects—from initial data acquisition to production deployment on both cloud and edge devices.

## Course Topics

### 1. Data Collection and Labeling

- **Collecting Data:** Tools for logging/instrumenting sources (e.g., websites) to collect usage data
- **Validating Data:** Data quality checks and validation pipelines
- **Labeling Data:** Tools such as Label Studio to annotate datasets, methods such as Cohen Kappa inter-annotator agreement, snowball sampling, active learning for cost-effective data annotation
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques to expand training datasets

### 2. Model and Code Reproducibility & Versioning

- **Architecture and Hyperparameter Search:** Tools such as Weights & Biases for architecture and hyperparameter search; AutoML tools such as AutoGluon
- **Model Checkpointing:** Tools such as MLFlow, Tensorboard/Weights & Biases for model/weights checkpointing
- **Data Versioning:** Version control for datasets and artifacts

### 3. Self-Contained Environments

- **Containerization:** Tools such as Docker for managing released packages
- **Cloud Platforms:** GCP/AWS/Azure for scalable deployment

### 4. Run-Time Profiling and Optimization

- Memory footprint analysis
- Measuring GPU utilization and optimizing it
- Performance bottleneck identification

### 5. Continuous Integration/Deployment

- **A/B Testing:** Experimental design and analysis
- **Distribution and Covariate Shift:** Data version management and retraining to account for shifts
- **Redeployment:** Strategies for updating models in production

### 6. Deployment on Constrained Devices

- **Model Optimization:** Tools such as TF-lite
- **Quantization:** Reducing model size while maintaining performance
- **Edge Deployment:** Strategies for resource-constrained environments
