## Overview

This course covers the **complete software engineering stack for modern AI development**. While most ML courses focus on algorithms, this course focuses on the engineering practices that make ML systems work in the real world—from data collection to production deployment.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

1. **Build end-to-end ML systems** — From data collection to production deployment
2. **Choose the right tools** — Know which tool to use for any data/ML task
3. **Write production code** — Code that others can understand, maintain, and reproduce

## Course Structure (15 Weeks)

| Part | Weeks | Topics |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Data Engineering** | 1–5 | Data collection, validation, labeling, augmentation |
| **Model Development** | 6–11 | LLM APIs, training, reproducibility, deployment, CI/CD |
| **Production** | 12–15 | Edge deployment, profiling, monitoring |

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Lab Assignments + Viva | 48% |
| Quizzes (best 3 of 4) | 42% |
